Parallel, Async, Real-Time Data Ops

p251:	Asynchronous controllers (AsyncController) - thread starvation
p253:	the async/awayt keywords and the Task<TResult> pattern
p254:	[AsyncTimeout(1000)]

p254:	When to use an asynchronous controller
	
	Use synchronous action when 
	-1 Simple and short running ops
	-2 Simplicity is more important than efficiency
	-3 there are CPU-intensive ops - async does not buy you anything in this case

	Use asynchronous action when 
	-1 the action is long running
	-2 there is lots of IO or Network traffic
	-3 WHEN THE USER REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO CANCEL A LONG-RUNNING OP


P254:	Real-Time Asynchronous Communication

	Models based on the HTTP request/response paradigm of short-lived connection
	Problem with synch model - data gets stale
	Problem with AJAX model - the user still need to trigger refresh

p255:	Real-Time communication models
p255:	HTTP Polling
	It is a client-side implementation
	It is a two-way communication mechanism.
	
	Mimiks a persistent connection to the server by timing AJAX requests on the clients
	One techniques is to AJAX the server on handling the response from the previous call
	This is equivalent to built-in fault tollerance
	
	It is very reliable and fail safe
	It develop huge network traffic and server load regardless whether there is new data
	can overload the server and cause DOS [Denial Of Service]
	The main point of difference between this and Http long polling is that in the HTTP 
	Polling the server closes the connaction to the client soon after sending the reply.

	Time Diagram

	Client		     Server

	request t1 -------->
		   <-------  response t1
			     close connection
	request t2 -------->
		   <-------  response t2
			     close connection
	etc.

p256:	HTTP long polling
	It is a server-side implementation.
	It is a two-way communication mechanism.
	
	The client browser makes AJAX request to the server to retrieve data.
	If the data is available the server replies and closes the connection as per the 
	traditional request/response model.
	
	However, the server keeps the connection to the client open if it cannot return 
	data to the client immediately and closes it only when
	-it can return the data
	-on a timeout expiry 
	-or when the connection is brocken.
	
	The incoming request is blocked on the server until a server event is raised to 
	signal that it can continue. The client must initiate a new long polling request 
	each time.

	It is unreliable because connections tend to brake often.

	Time Diagram

	Client		     Server

	request t1 -------->
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event	
		   <-------  response t1 + dt1
			     close connection
	
        request t2 -------->
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event
		   <-------  response t2 + dt2
			     close connection
	etc.

p257	Server-Sent Events aka EventSource	
	It is a one-way communication mechanism - from server to client.

	Similar to long polling as the server attempts to keep the connection to the client 
	open if it cannot return the data immediately.

	The differnce is that the server will try to maintain the connectin open even after 
	the initial response is returned to the client as updates to the data initially requested
	become available to the server.However, the client needs a new connection, that is a new
	AJAX request if it needs to request other data or to sent new data to the server.
	The server can then decide to return the response for any new client request on a new
	connection or any existing one or both.
	
	The Server-Sent/EventSource Real-RealTime asynchronous communication relies on the 
	standard JavaScript library *Event Source API* used to receive server-sent events
	which is part of the largest HTML5 implementation.
	
  	*Event Source API*
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource

	Most browser support *Event Source API* (not IE!)
	

	request t1 -------->
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event	
		  <-------  response t1 + dt1
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event
	          <-------  response t1 + dt2
                             Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event
	   	  <-------  response t1 + dt3

			
                            The server uses the same connection until it is broken.


P258: 	Web Sockets api https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API

	WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive 
	communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you 
	can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to 
	poll the server for a reply
	--------------------------------------------------------
	Converts standards HTTP request/response connections 
        into 
	bidirectional, full-duplex TCP communications channels
	--------------------------------------------------------

	More recent version also supports secure duplex ove tcp.

	Most browsers support WebSocket API.
	Browser support is the minimal requirement.
	Antivirus software, firewalls and HTTP proxies can interfere with WebSocket API.

	Time Diagram

	Client		     	  Server

	http request t1 :

p259 	SignalR
	
	SignalR is an open source asynchronous signaling library.
	It is an abstraction over HTTP.
	The SignalR library consists of a Server API + a client JavaScript library.
	It is ditributed by means of a nuget package (SignalR)

	It supports several Transport Models
	-WebSockets
	-Server-sent/EventSource
	-Forever frames
	-Long Polling
	
	It offers two programming models: 
	-------------------------------------------------------------
p260	1-Persistent Connection
	
	On the Server
	
	Create a class inheriting from SignalR.PersistentConnection.
	Override SignalR.PersistentConnection.OnReceivedAsynch.
	Register the custom connection in the routing table RouteTable.Routes.MapConnection<EbuyCustomConnection>("echo","echo/{*operation}").
	Regiter all the connection Ids you need for the app.
	The SignalR.PersistentConnection.OnReceivedAsynch uses a connectionId matching the registerd connection in the routing table.

	Server => Client
	The PersistentConnection.Connection property as methods to send data to any connected client. 

	On the client
	
	Use jQuery you'll need it to grab the connection object.
	Add a reference to the required SignalR JavaScript library <scriptsrc="Scripts/jquery.signalR-0.5.0.min.js"type="text/javascript"></script>	
	subscribe to the connection object (by its Id) received event and provide a callback.	
	The callback parameter is the payload.
	Start the connection after subscribing.
	
	Client => Server
	To send data to the server over teh connection use connection.send(payload).
	The payload will reach the server's SignalR.PersistentConnection.OnReceivedAsynch.
	Subscribe to any other connection object by its Id and follow the same steps.			
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p261	2-Hubs 

	This model does not require to register a sepcial route on the Server side.
	
	On the Server
	
	Create a class that inherits from SignalR.Hub
	Add a method to send messages with signature >> public void SendMessage(stringmessage)	
	Any hub on the server side automatically register a special route "/signalr"

	Server => Client	
	In this method the server uses the Clients dynamic object to add dynamic methods i.e. Clients.displayMessage(message);
	This means that Clients.displayMessage(message) sends message to any of the clients connected to the Hub.
	Client will receive the payload "message" if they subscribe to it by providing a callback function on for the same method on the proxy.

        On the Client
	Use jQuery you'll need it to grab teh connection object.
	Include the SignalR JavaScript library <scriptsrc="Scripts/jquery.signalR-0.5.0.min.js"type="text/javascript"></script>
	*Include teh SignalR JavaScript library for the Huib model <scriptsrc="/signalr/hubs"type="text/javascript"></script>
	Use jQury to grab a reference to Hub proxy on the connection object varproxy=$.connection.ebuyCustomHub;
	Use the proxy to register a callback for the dynamically defined methods on the server side i.e. proxy.displayMessage=function(message){..do sth with "message" payload..}
	Start the Hub on the connection objects i.e. $.connection.hub.start();
	The client can communicate data to the server like this connection.sendMessage("Hello SignalR!");
	-------------------------------------------------------------

p263:	SignalR can be configured.
	During application startup i.e.
	GlobalHost.Configuration.ConnectionTimeout=TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60);
	The Configuration object will be an implementation of IConfigurationManager.
	IConfigurationManager
		ConnectionTimeout	=>How long the an idle connection stays open
		DisconnectionTimeout 	=>Time to raise a disconnected event to clients
		HeartBeatInterval	=>How often to chek the state of teh connection 
		KeepAlive		=>Time interval to send a keep alive ping to an idle connection
					  Keep alive makes ConnactionTimeout irrelevant.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p263:	Configure IIS for SignalR to increase the number of concurrent requests

	1-Configure IIS to support higher than default concurrent connections
	From command line
	%windir%\System32\inetsrv\
	ppcmd.exe set config /section:serverRuntime /appConcurrentRequestLimit:100000

	2-Configure ASP.NET 4.0 to support in excess of the default 5000 CONNECTION PER cpu
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319   for   32-bit
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Frame-work64\v4.0.30319 for 64-bit operating systems
	In aspnet.config
	<applicationPool maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU="20000"/>

	3-Configure ASP.NET 4.0 for a larger size throttling queue tahn the default 
	ASP.NET 4.0 will queue (throttle) the request in exxcess of maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU.
	When the queue fills up the connections are lost.
	To control the size ofthe throttling queue 
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319   for   32-bit
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Frame-work64\v4.0.30319 for 64-bit operating systems
	machine.config
	<processModelautoConfig="false"requestQueueLimit="250000"/>
================================================================================================
p265	Chapter 12 Caching

	Types of caching available in ASP.NET

-----------------------------------------------
P266	Server side caching
	Data caching  - data is cached not HTML
-----------------------------------------------
	
	Limit the time necessary to produce a response.
	Limit the number of CPU cycles per request.
	Limit call to services.
	Limit roundtrips to data storage.
	Limit teh amount of server resources per request.

p266	Client side caching
	Avoid t make any request to the server if at all possible.
	Helps with reducing the load on the server.
	Helps with reducing the load on the network.

p266	Server side caching techniques
	These are almost all provided within the ASP.NET Framework rather than MVC.	

p267	Request-scoped caching - System.Web.HttpContext.Items 	
	This HttpContext instance is available on the server side per each request.
	The Items property is dictionary.
	The HttpContext lives for teh lifetime of teh request and so Items.
	Use Items to store data relevant for the current request.
	i.e. HttpContext.Items["IsFirstTimeUser"] = true;
	It is strongly typed - must cast when reading from it.

p268	User-scoped caching via ASP.NET Session State
	This caching mechanism allows to store info between requests.
	The info lifespan is per session and per-user basis.
	Session can be enabled on disabled on IIS via Web.Config.
	The duration of the session can be changed via Web.Config (20' default).
	<system.web><sessionStatetimeout="30"/></system.web>
	Session state data must be persisted in some way the options are
	-in memeory (default)
	-SQL Server database
	-Custom provider.
	How it works : HttpContex.Session["username"] = "Jo";
	string = (string)HttpContext.Session["username"]
	Session expires on time or when the user closes the browser.

p268	Application-scoped caching
	HttpContext.Application is an instance of HttpApplicationState.
	This is an untyped dictionary of objects.
	The data lifespan is that of the IIS worker process.
	Use only when the the data is the same accorss worker processes.

p269	The ASP.NET Cache (better than HttpContext.Application)
	This is a better alternative to store application-level data.
	System.Web.Cache >> HttpContext.Cache.
	It is just like any othe of the untyped dictionaries above.
	ASP.NET raises events when items in HttpContext.Cache expires or are removed.
	ASP.NET manages the lifetime of the items in HttpContext.Cache.
	
	Can set the expiration model and time per item.
	-expiration => when the item is added to HttpContext.Cache it is specified
	sliding or absolute expiration. 
			
	Can specify dependency on other objects
	i.e. 
	-files on disk when are removed or modified.
	-other item in HttpContext.Cache specified by its key in the dictionary.
	-SQL. Updates to a specific table.	
	-Custom. System.Web.Caching.Cache.Dependency can be inherited from and you 
	 can provide the logic for the event to be raised.
	-Aggregate. Allows to combine any of the above.

	Removal of items from Http.Cache
	-a chanche item's dependancy changes and invaliadte the item.
	-Scavanging. The server runs low on resources and must reclaim memory

	The CancheItemRemovedCallbackhandles the removal event.

-----------------------------------------------
p270	The Output Cache
	In this type of caching HTML is cached.
-----------------------------------------------

p271	[OutputCacheAttribute(Duration=60, VaryByParam="name")]
	
	This action filter tells the controller to add the result of the controller
	to the output cache.
	
	Configuration of [OutputCacheAttribute()] is possible by means of parameters
	
(p272)  Tab 12-2
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	CacheProfile* 		The name of the output cache policy to use
	Duration* 		The amount of time in seconds to cache the content	
	Enabled*		Enables/disables output cache for the current content	
	LocationThe 		location of where to cache the content	
	NoStore*		Enables/disables HTTP Cache-Control
	SqlDependency		The database and table name pairs that the cache entry depends on		
	VaryByContentEncoding	A comma-delimited list of character sets (content encodings) that the output cache uses to varythe cache entries
	VaryByCustom		A list of custom strings that the output cache uses to vary the cache entries
	VaryByHeader		A comma-delimited list of HTTP header names used to vary the cache entries	
	VaryByParam*		A semicolon-delimited list of form POST or query string parameters that the output cache uses tovary the cache entry
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	-Location : Any(default), Client, Downstream, Server, None
	-NoStore=true/false

p271	-Location=Any 
	it's ok in most scenarios, but those with some data on the page that must 
	change with the user identity i.e. teh user name. If Any is used all users 
	get the user name of the first user that caused the page to be cached.

	-Caching only on the user's browser
	-Location=OutputCacheLocation.Client, NoStore=true
	This caches the page on the user's browser and fixes the propblem above.

	The other options for Locations are less common.	
	
p272 	The VaryByParam 
	[OutputCache(Duration = int.MaxValue, VaryByParam = "id")]

	In this example ASP.NET caches the output per each id value found in the query 
	string. Without VaryByParam = "id" the server would cache only the detail view
	of the first request coming i.e. id=101 in and would keep serve the detail view 
	for id=101 to any subsequent request.

	VaryByParam = "none"
	ASP.NET caches the page the firts time it is rendered and keep serving it 
	indefinitely. This is all right with static content.

	VaryByParam = "*"
	ASP.NET adds a specific cached version of a page any time a new request comes in 
	with at least one of the parameter different from any of the query for which a 
	page has already been cached. 
	This option can cause significant memory load.

	The Duration sets for how long the output cache is held in memory.

p273	Output cache profiles
	http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/improving-performance-with-output-caching-cs

	An alternative to using [OutputCacheAttibute] on single controller actions.
	It is possible to create a global output caching rule in web.config.
	Better for maintainability.
	Applying changes to teh output caching policy no longer require recompiling and redeploying!
	
	
	For example, the following ProductCache profile caches a page’s content for an hour
	and varies each cache by the "id" request parameter:
	<caching><outputCacheSettings><outputCacheProfiles><addname="ProductCache"duration="3600"varyByParam="id"/></outputCacheProfiles></outputCacheSettings></caching>

	The cache profile can then be applied to a controller action method by decorating it
	with the attribute [OutputCache(CacheProfile="Cache1Hour")] where the name of the 
	profile is the same specified in the web.config.
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p273 	Donut Caching - most of the html on the page should be cached but section(s) 

	It is possible to cache an html leaving out some of its sections i.e. the area
	that displays user's specific information. For a log in page do not use solution 
	VaryByParam = "id" because this causes a complete page to be cached per each user!
		
	-In Web Forms vie engine 
	Donut caching is usppported directly via the tag asp:Substitution.
	<asp:Substitution runat="server"MethodName="GetUserName"/>
	Then define a static callback method "GetUserName" on the server that returns the HTML 
	that is not cached.

	-In Razor view engine

	http://www.adamriddick.com/2013/06/asp-net-mvc4-donut-caching-donut-hole-caching/
	
	There's no direct support but there is a NuGet package
	https://github.com/moonpyk/mvcdonutcaching
	
	It can be done by means of the HttpResponse class.  
	Flush out an extension method of the HtmlHelper class such as

	public static object Substitution(this HtmlHelper html,CacheCallback ccb)

	together with the delegate CacheCallback below

	public delegate string CacheCallback(HttpContextBase context);

  	In HtmlHelper.Substitution the html param can be used to access the HttpResponse
	
	html.ViewContext.HttpContext.Response.WriteSubstitution(...)

	WriteSubstitution takes a delegate which can be 

	c=>HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(ccb(newHttpContextWrapper(c))

	Notice that this will cause the ccb callback to be invoked bassing the HttpContext c
	to it.

	In a view use the Html helper in your markup

	@Html.Substitution(context => context.User.Identity.Name)

	The result is that the view is cached except for the html returned by the 
	html.ViewContext.HttpContext.Response.WriteSubstitution(...)
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p275  	Donut Hole Caching & child actions

	This is the inverse of DoNut caching. In Donut caching most of the HTML in a page
	is cached and some smaller UI details are written to the output stream via dedicated 
	static methods which are invoked at each new request for the same page.

	In Donut Hole caching instead only smaller parts of the HTML for a requested page is 
	cached. This is useful when the page embeds large lists of static data.

	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12530016/what-is-an-mvc-child-action
	http://haacked.com/archive/2009/11/18/aspnetmvc2-render-action.aspx/
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Contrary to Donut caching, Donut Hole caching has direct support in MVC by means 
	of child actions.
	
	An action in a controller is a child action when is decorated with the attribute
	[ChildActionOnly]. This attributes means that the action method cannot be routed 
	to by MVC directly that is it is no possible to invoke child actions by means of 
	an URL.Child actions can only be invoked from a Parent View. In order to invoke a 
	child action from a view you use @Html.Action("ChildActionName"). This action will 
	then execute and render its output in the master view at the location of the call 
	@Html.Action("ChildActionName"). Child action execute in the context of the same 
	Http request as that for the parent view they are invoked from.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p277	Distributed Caching

	It is an extension or the traditional caching techniques by which data for a session 
	or from a database is stored in a central location and made available to all instances 
	of an application. This is necessary i.e. in the web farm scenario where a particular 
	instance of an application may return to a different server on each request. 
	Without distributed caching the server may have to recreate the same data that was 
	created for teh same client on a previous request but on another server. This is 
	clearly inefficient and slower than caching the relevant data for all the servers of the
	farm.
	

	There are three metrics that are improved by distributed caching
	
	-Performance - higher serving rate and less resources i.e. queries to teh SQL Server
	 Better read performance beacause servers do not need to recreate data that already 
	 exists all the time.
	
	-Scalability - more flexibility
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee677312(v=azure.10).aspx
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 It is easy to add more capacity when necessary. For example, under load a server 
	 can be added to the cluster and then removed when the load is lower. 

	-Redundancy -Failover
	 If one server fails the data for the session remains in the distributed cache and 
	 the session is not lost. Another server can pick up the request of the same client
	 after failure of the server.

	The process is simple: anytime you access a web page, the browser checks the local disk to 
	see if it has local copies of any files that are part of the page. If not, it downloads the 
	resources from the server. For the first visit to a page, this amounts to everything.
	The browser caches the resources by storing them locally on the hard disk in a pre-allocated
	area of predefined size.  The browser takes care of clearing out old items and managing the 
	resources without any intervention or input required from the user.
	
	There are several issuses with client-side caching such as bugs, security, lack of control.
	
	-App Cache
	HTML5 specification aims to eliminate differences in the mechanism of client-side caching.

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Freshness, Validation, Invalidation
	These three factors control the caching mechanism on the browser and they all are dependent 
	on the HTTP headers in the request
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	===========================================================================================
 	-Freshness
	This can be controlled by both the server and the client.
	It is used to detetermine whether a specific responce can be provided to the client without 
	a round trip to teh server. 
	
	Response Headers and Browser Directive
	
	- Expires
	In the header sent by the server to the client it is the date when the response document becomes 
	stale. 
	
	- Cache-Control: max-age 
	directice that instructs the client cache how long, in seconds, to consider the response 
	fresh.	

	//In the server side code 	
	//set the cache control header to public to let the browser cache the response if they want to
	Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public);
	//set the the Cache-Control directive to a set time	
	Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(20));
	//set the Expire response header
	Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Parse("11:00:00PM"));

	============================================================================================
p283	-Validation
	What happens when a response becomes stale, that is it is no longer fresh?
	A response might be no longer fresh but that does not always mean that it is not reusable.
	This depends on whether the response has been modified on the server.

	Response Headers and Browser Directive

	Last-Modified response header / If-Modified-Since request header
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	If the response has the Last-Modified header the client can request the response using the 
	header If-Modified-Since. This mechanism allows the client to check whether the response's
	changed on the server.

	//In the server code
	//Sets the Last-Modified HTTP header to the DateTime value 
	supplied.Response.Cache.SetLastModified(DateTime.Parse("1/1/2012 00:00:01AM"));
	
	ETag (Enitty Tag) - a more robust approach
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	//In the server side code
	//Sets the ETag HTTP header to the specified 
	string.Response.Cache.SetETag("\"someuniquestring:version\"");	
	
	===========================================================================================	
p283	-Invalidation
	
	Server side resources might change as a consequence of updates such as those caused by HTTP 
	verbs POST, PUT, DELETE. When a URL on the server is recepient of an HTTP request with such 
	verbs the response is invalidated.

	===========================================================================================
p283	HTML5 App Cache

	The HTML 5 specification defines the ApplicationCache (or AppCache) API to givedevelopers 
	direct access to the local browser content cache. 
	An application will be able to make use of the HTML5 App Cache specification on modern browsers
	with the proviso that the following steps are taken.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Define the manifest.(.manifest extension, CACHE MANIFEST first line, # version 1.x)
	   In the manifest some keywords are used at the beginning of each section such as
	   # resources that are cached client-side after the first trip to the serve 
	   CACHE: 
	   *.html 
 	   *.css, 
	   *.js, 
           *.ico 
	   NETWORK: login.asmx # what you never whant to cache and that must laways fetched from the server
	   FALLBACK: /Home/Index.html /index.html 

	2. Reference the manifest by using the manifest attribute of the <html>
	   The browser si instructed to download the manifest file. 
	   <!DOCTYPE html><html manifest="site.manifest">...</html>           		           

	3. Serve the manifest to the user. This requires the use of the appropriate MIME that in 
	   ASP.NET is set via the ContentType of the Response.
   	   Response.ContentType="text/cache-manifest";
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	When App Cache is enabled on the client browser, it will fetch resources from the server when

	1. The user clears the cache.
	2. The myapplication.manifest is altered on the server in any way.
	3. The cache is updated programmatically by JavaScript in the browser.

p286	HTML5 Local Storage - cookies improved!
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19867599/what-is-the-difference-between-localstorage-sessionstorage-session-and-cookies

	This specification is fro browsers to support an off-line storage mechanism.
	There are not size limits as for the case of cookies, thus large amnount of data can be stored.
	There are two local storage endpoints.

	Local Storage 
	The data stored via this endpoint is stored indefinitely.	
	5MB on most browsers by default according to specs. The app can request more and the browser will 
	prompt the user to accept or decline.	
	
	// test whether the browser support HYML5 local storage
	functionIsLocalStorageSupported(){try{return'localStorage'inwindow&&window['localStorage']!==null;}catch(e){returnfalse;}}

	// test for space - QuotaExceededError
	localStorage.remainingSpace()
 
	// the bracketed version works too..
	// store stufff in the dictionary
	localStorage.setItem("userName","john");
	localStorage.setItem("age",32);
	
	localStorage.removeItem("userName");

	//retrieve from local storage - must parse!
	varuserName=localStorage.getItem("userName");
	varage=parseInt(localStorage.getItem("age"));
	
	localStorage.clear();
	
	Session Storage
	The data stored via this endpoint is erased at the end of the user session - the browser is closed.
