Parallel, Async, Real-Time Data Ops

p251:	Asynchronous controllers (AsyncController) - thread starvation
p253:	the async/awayt keywords and the Task<TResult> pattern
p254:	[AsyncTimeout(1000)]

p254:	When to use an asynchronous controller
	
	Use synchronous action when 
	-1 Simple and short running ops
	-2 Simplicity is more important than efficiency
	-3 there are CPU-intensive ops - async does not buy you anything in this case

	Use asynchronous action when 
	-1 the action is long running
	-2 there is lots of IO or Network traffic
	-3 WHEN THE USER REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO CANCEL A LONG-RUNNING OP


P254:	Real-Time Asynchronous Communication

	Models based on the HTTP request/response paradigm of short-lived connection
	Problem with synch model - data gets stale
	Problem with AJAX model - the user still need to trigger refresh

p255:	Real-Time communication models
p255:	HTTP Polling
	It is a client-side implementation
	It is a two-way communication mechanism.
	
	Mimiks a persistent connection to the server by timing AJAX requests on the clients
	One techniques is to AJAX the server on handling the response from the previous call
	This is equivalent to built-in fault tollerance
	
	It is very reliable and fail safe
	It develop huge network traffic and server load regardless whether there is new data
	can overload the server and cause DOS [Denial Of Service]
	The main point of difference between this and Http long polling is that in the HTTP 
	Polling the server closes the connaction to the client soon after sending the reply.

	Time Diagram

	Client		     Server

	request t1 -------->
		   <-------  response t1
			     close connection
	request t2 -------->
		   <-------  response t2
			     close connection
	etc.

p256:	HTTP long polling
	It is a server-side implementation.
	It is a two-way communication mechanism.
	
	The client browser makes AJAX request to the server to retrieve data.
	If the data is available the server replies and closes the connection as per the 
	traditional request/response model.
	
	However, the server keeps the connection to the client open if it cannot return 
	data to the client immediately and closes it only when
	-it can return the data
	-on a timeout expiry 
	-or when the connection is brocken.
	
	The incoming request is blocked on the server until a server event is raised to 
	signal that it can continue. The client must initiate a new long polling request 
	each time.

	It is unreliable because connections tend to brake often.

	Time Diagram

	Client		     Server

	request t1 -------->
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event	
		   <-------  response t1 + dt1
			     close connection
	
        request t2 -------->
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event
		   <-------  response t2 + dt2
			     close connection
	etc.

p257	Server-Sent Events aka EventSource	
	It is a one-way communication mechanism - from server to client.

	Similar to long polling as the server attempts to keep the connection to the client 
	open if it cannot return the data immediately.

	The differnce is that the server will try to maintain the connectin open even after 
	the initial response is returned to the client as updates to the data initially requested
	become available to the server.However, the client needs a new connection, that is a new
	AJAX request if it needs to request other data or to sent new data to the server.
	The server can then decide to return the response for any new client request on a new
	connection or any existing one or both.
	
	The Server-Sent/EventSource Real-RealTime asynchronous communication relies on the 
	standard JavaScript library *Event Source API* used to receive server-sent events
	which is part of the largest HTML5 implementation.
	
  	*Event Source API*
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource

	Most browser support *Event Source API* (not IE!)
	

	request t1 -------->
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event	
		  <-------  response t1 + dt1
			     Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event
	          <-------  response t1 + dt2
                             Server Idle
			     Server Idle
			     ....
			     Server Event
	   	  <-------  response t1 + dt3

			
                            The server uses the same connection until it is broken.


P258: 	Web Sockets api https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API

	WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive 
	communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you 
	can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to 
	poll the server for a reply
	--------------------------------------------------------
	Converts standards HTTP request/response connections 
        into 
	bidirectional, full-duplex TCP communications channels
	--------------------------------------------------------

	More recent version also supports secure duplex ove tcp.

	Most browsers support WebSocket API.
	Browser support is the minimal requirement.
	Antivirus software, firewalls and HTTP proxies can interfere with WebSocket API.

	Time Diagram

	Client		     	  Server

	http request t1 :
	can I uses WebSocket?		
			-------->
			<-------  http response t1 + dt1
				  Yes, this is the Encrypted Key
	=========================================================
	tcp
	this is my payload		
			-------->
			<-------  tcp ok
	========================================================				
        			  tcp

p259 	SignalR
	
	SignalR is an open source asynchronous signaling library.
	It is an abstraction over HTTP.
	The SignalR library consists of a Server API + a client JavaScript library.
	It is ditributed by means of a nuget package (SignalR)

	It supports several Transport Models
	-WebSockets
	-Server-sent/EventSource
	-Forever frames
	-Long Polling
	
	It offers two programming models: 
	-------------------------------------------------------------
p260	1-Persistent Connection
	
	On the Server
	
	Create a class inheriting from SignalR.PersistentConnection.
	Override SignalR.PersistentConnection.OnReceivedAsynch.
	Register the custom connection in the routing table RouteTable.Routes.MapConnection<EbuyCustomConnection>("echo","echo/{*operation}").
	Regiter all the connection Ids you need for the app.
	The SignalR.PersistentConnection.OnReceivedAsynch uses a connectionId matching the registerd connection in the routing table.

	Server => Client
	The PersistentConnection.Connection property as methods to send data to any connected client. 

	On the client
	
	Use jQuery you'll need it to grab the connection object.
	Add a reference to the required SignalR JavaScript library <scriptsrc="Scripts/jquery.signalR-0.5.0.min.js"type="text/javascript"></script>	
	subscribe to the connection object (by its Id) received event and provide a callback.	
	The callback parameter is the payload.
	Start the connection after subscribing.
	
	Client => Server
	To send data to the server over teh connection use connection.send(payload).
	The payload will reach the server's SignalR.PersistentConnection.OnReceivedAsynch.
	Subscribe to any other connection object by its Id and follow the same steps.			
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p261	2-Hubs 

	This model does not require to register a sepcial route on the Server side.
	
	On the Server
	
	Create a class that inherits from SignalR.Hub
	Add a method to send messages with signature >> public void SendMessage(stringmessage)	
	Any hub on the server side automatically register a special route "/signalr"

	Server => Client	
	In this method the server uses the Clients dynamic object to add dynamic methods i.e. Clients.displayMessage(message);
	This means that Clients.displayMessage(message) sends message to any of the clients connected to the Hub.
	Client will receive the payload "message" if they subscribe to it by providing a callback function on for the same method on the proxy.

        On the Client
	Use jQuery you'll need it to grab teh connection object.
	Include the SignalR JavaScript library <scriptsrc="Scripts/jquery.signalR-0.5.0.min.js"type="text/javascript"></script>
	*Include teh SignalR JavaScript library for the Huib model <scriptsrc="/signalr/hubs"type="text/javascript"></script>
	Use jQury to grab a reference to Hub proxy on the connection object varproxy=$.connection.ebuyCustomHub;
	Use the proxy to register a callback for the dynamically defined methods on the server side i.e. proxy.displayMessage=function(message){..do sth with "message" payload..}
	Start the Hub on the connection objects i.e. $.connection.hub.start();
	The client can communicate data to the server like this connection.sendMessage("Hello SignalR!");
	-------------------------------------------------------------

p263:	SignalR can be configured.
	During application startup i.e.
	GlobalHost.Configuration.ConnectionTimeout=TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60);
	The Configuration object will be an implementation of IConfigurationManager.
	IConfigurationManager
		ConnectionTimeout	=>How long the an idle connection stays open
		DisconnectionTimeout 	=>Time to raise a disconnected event to clients
		HeartBeatInterval	=>How often to chek the state of teh connection 
		KeepAlive		=>Time interval to send a keep alive ping to an idle connection
					  Keep alive makes ConnactionTimeout irrelevant.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p263:	Configure IIS for SignalR to increase the number of concurrent requests

	1-Configure IIS to support higher than default concurrent connections
	From command line
	%windir%\System32\inetsrv\
	ppcmd.exe set config /section:serverRuntime /appConcurrentRequestLimit:100000

	2-Configure ASP.NET 4.0 to support in excess of the default 5000 CONNECTION PER cpu
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319   for   32-bit
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Frame-work64\v4.0.30319 for 64-bit operating systems
	In aspnet.config
	<applicationPool maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU="20000"/>

	3-Configure ASP.NET 4.0 for a larger size throttling queue tahn the default 
	ASP.NET 4.0 will queue (throttle) the request in exxcess of maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU.
	When the queue fills up the connections are lost.
	To control the size ofthe throttling queue 
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319   for   32-bit
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Frame-work64\v4.0.30319 for 64-bit operating systems
	machine.config
	<processModelautoConfig="false"requestQueueLimit="250000"/>
